            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am an engineer with a passion for technology. Upon earning a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, I started my career as a control systems engineer. It was my job to design, develop, and commission the software and systems for mission-critical infrastructure. My team and I successfully fulfilled the project life cycle for multiple hyperscale data centers. We helped build the cloud.
            <br>
            <p>As a control systems engineer, I found joy for programming, troubleshooting, and supporting colleagues. Additionally, I developed a deep curiosity for cloud technology and the workings of innumerable data center servers.
            <br>
            <p> I started exploring AWS, python scripts, and various devops tools, realizing how they can simplify life and streamline development processes. My expertise in networking from my control systems engineering background proved valuable for understanding cloud infrastructure. That's when I decided it was possible to make a career shift. I solidified an understanding of network engineering by earning the CCNA. Likewise, I've been building my skills and knowledge in cloud technology, IT automation, and devops practices ever since.

            <h3>Projects:</h3>
            <p>Here are a couple projects I've done:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Tutorial: How to Create a CI/CD Pipeline for Amazon ECS with Jenkins and Docker</dt>
              <dd>For this project, I created a detailed and extensive tutorial on how to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys a Node.js application to a container within a AWS ECS cluster. The links to the article and GitHub repo for this project are listed below.

              <dt>Tutorial: How I Created A On-Demand High Performance Professional Website with Terraform and AWS</dt>
              <dd>For this next project, I explain how I created a secure, high-performing website with AWS CloudFront that can be launched and destroyed automatically with Terraform. This is actually an explanation of how I created this very website. The Terraform files are templated and available to the public via my GitHub repo.
